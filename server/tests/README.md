# How To Use Pytest

## File structure

- `integration` & `unit` Folders: Common directories for unit and integration tests in python.
- `test_examples.py`: An example file for learning `pytest` usage.
- `fixtures`: Reusable test setup and data management functions for pytest.
- [`conftest.py`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/fixture.html#conftest-py-sharing-fixtures-across-multiple-files): Serves as a means of providing fixtures for an entire directory.
